## General Approach

First step that we did, was to brainstorm for the user story and did a rough sketch of what our website would look like. We then wrote down the database table of what is needed for our API so that we know what are the primary keys for our database. After coming up with the database, we decided on what technologies we would use to run our API on.

After we have all the components and ideas of how our website would look like, we then divide the task of building our website.
