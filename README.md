* AJAX

* Handlebars

### Back End:
* Ruby On Rails

* PostgreSQL

## General Approach

First step that we did, was to brainstorm the user story and did a rough sketch of what our website would look like. We then wrote down the database table and entity relationship diagram of what is needed for our API so that we know what are the primary keys and relationships for our database. After coming up with the database, we designed the wireframes and decided on what technologies we would use to run our API on.

After we have all the components and ideas of how our website would look like, we then divided the task of building our website according to front end and back end design of the website.

## [User story](https://trello.com/b/el27sM6w/job-diary):
* As a job-seeker, I want to register an account so I can login.

* As a job-seeker, I want to add a job I'm applying for.

* As a job-seeker, I want to see the jobs, I've applied for.

* As a job-seeker, I want to edit my job listings so I can track my application progress.

* As a careers coach, I want to view the jobs my clients have applied for.

* As a user I want to add jobs, I will not apply for, so that other users can be notified of jobs available. (i.e Job Board Feature)

## [Wireframes](https://github.com/machr/job-tracker/wireframes): *Also available in wireframes folder.*

## Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles:

* Using github branch files to merge files (i.e. conflicting file issues).

* Seedfile status not in sync between team members' files.

* Few bugs was found when updating job listing record.

* Limited time to include admin login so that admin can view jobs that the clients have applied for.
