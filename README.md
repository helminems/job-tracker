## General Approach

First step that we did, was to brainstorm for the user story and did a rough sketch of what our website would look like. We then wrote down the database table and models of what is needed for our API so that we know what are the primary keys and relationships for our database. After coming up with the database, we designed the wireframes decided on what technologies we would use to run our API on.


After we have all the components and ideas of how our website would look like, we then divide the task of building our website.
